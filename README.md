## Data Description
Given is the variable name, variable type, the measurement unit and a brief description. 
The concrete compressive strength is the regression problem. The order of this listing 
corresponds to the order of numerals along the rows of the database. 


| Name | Data Type | Measurement | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|Cement (component 1)|	quantitative |	kg in a m3 mixture |	Input Variable  | 
| Blast Furnace Slag (component 2) |	quantitative |	kg in a m3 mixture	| Input Variable-- Blast furnace slag is a nonmetallic coproduct produced in the process. It consists primarily of silicates, aluminosilicates, and calcium-alumina-silicates  |
